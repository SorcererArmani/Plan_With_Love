# react-app-simple-music-app

A Simple Music Application using [React JS](https://react.dev/learn), a JavaScript library to make awesome UI by Facebook, [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs), [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) and [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/).

This application uses **component oriented UI** creation paradigm. All components are written in [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) and ES6 style and are combined to get a single build for production purpose using [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

[tsc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) is used to _transpile_ all [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) code to vanilla JavaScript code. For UI creation [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) and [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) are used.

This is a _responsive web application_ for viewing in both Mobile and Desktop.

Back end is implemented using [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs), [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
